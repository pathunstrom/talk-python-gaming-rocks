<<< Generic Introduction >>>

I'm Piper Thunstrom, a senior software engineer at Zipari, a community
organizer in the Python community, and an open source maintainer. Outside of
those official capacities, I'm also a game developer.

Python game development is approaching something of a rebirth right now and
I want to encourage more folks to dig into the amazing ecosystem. You might
be asking "Why Python?" I started programming after college by working my
way through Al Sweigart's Inventing Games with Python and Pygame. I've used
game dev as my sandbox for learning new software related skills throughout
my career.

Most recently, I experimented with a number of APIs for behavior trees in
python, open sourcing the result as Misbehave. One game jam, many years ago
now, I built a rudimentary MVC framework from scratch. It was not one of my
brightest ideas: I didn't finish the game, but that code did inspire the
original prototype of PursuedPyBear (which I'll be calling ppb from here
on), a game engine designed for education and flattening the learning curve
for game making.

So let's talk about the rebirth I mentioned. My co-maintainer started a
great website intended to compile all of the great tools Python has for game
development, and I'd like to briefly go over them.
