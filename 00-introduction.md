<<< Generic Introduction >>>

I'm Piper Thunstrom, a senior software engineer at Zipari, a community organizer in the Python community, and an open
source maintainer. Outside of those official capacities, I'm also a game developer.

Python game development is approaching something of a rebirth right now and I want to encourage more folks to dig into the
amazing ecosystem. You might be asking "Why Python?" I started programming after college by working my way through Al Sweigart's
Inventing Games with Python and Pygame. I've used game dev as my sandbox for learning new software related skills throughout
my career, including team leadership. And I'm the author of one of the current Python game libraries, PursuedPyBear.

So let's talk about the rebirth I mentioned. My co-maintainer started a great website intended to compile all of the great tools
Python has for game development, and I'd like to briefly go over them.
