So what does ppb offer to set itself apart?

First, ppb has been for a long time a user-centric project. We've identified
our core user demographics as learners, educators, and hobbyist. Learners
were a natural extension of the number one request I received in the early
days of the project: that ppb be made into a first in class tool for the
classroom. Teachers got included because if a teacher can't use the tool,
they can't teach with it. And finally hobbyists became a core demographic
when we started thinking about the long time learning path of students: many
people who learn to code in games continue making games as they stop being
considered students.

By identifying these groups, we're in the process of becoming a community
driven project. A few times of year we have a semi-open meeting with
stakeholders from the core development team, and each of our core
demographics (currently excepting students due to not having many that have
joined the community). This meeting helps plan our long, medium, and short
term goals as a project.

Our hobbyist focus led us to make sure ppb isn't one set of opinions: The
entire system is modular and extensible. You can subclass the various
components with confidence, replace defaults when needed, and even rip out
which hardware backing you use and replace it with your own.

The most important selling point though is that we've picked a stable and
useful set of defaults that allow you start building immediately. We pick a
resolution, a set of subsystems that let you handle things like input and
sound. Sprites get a default colored block with no code.
