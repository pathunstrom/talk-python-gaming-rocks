Let's start at the top: I'm an API designer at heart. A lot of what I did
not like about other options on this list is a combination of having to
think about problems the way those libraries forced me to and apis that
didn't feel like Python. So when I started ppb it was mostly to just have
something that worked in the way I liked.

That version was, in a word, awful. I actually couldn't build a game myself
in it, let alone anyone else. That set me on a journey to really learn API
design and apply those lessons immediately. Around the same time I was
showing people this newer engine I was working on, I started getting asked
by teachers if it could be designed around the classroom environment.

That ask became my, and eventually our, driving force: what would a Python
game engine need to be to be genuinely the best tool for the classroom. With
the note that not all education is equal, I set down that road. The first
thing I realized was that the boilerplate had to go. Why did it take 20
lines of python to have a window that you could close?

So I'd already thrown out 0.1 of ppb at that point, and started building. I
focused on a handful of things: Python is object oriented, and getting used
to that would be important. Also, Python was at its best when you could
focus only on the problem you wanted to solve and nothing else. So I focused
on making rendering easier and easier.
