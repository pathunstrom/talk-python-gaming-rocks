So the new world of python game making is here, and if you've not tried
it lately, you should definitely dive right in. Python now has a pile of
game libraries and growing regularly. There's an engine or framework for
just about every taste. A lot of us are putting effort into new tools to
make the experience even better.

Even if you're not wanting to go indie or build games to sell, you can
always work on projects for fun or even use game development as your own
personal sandbox for learning new concepts in a space that can't
possibly break in a way that could hurt.

And while you're checking out the language and tooling, get involved in
the community. It's a bit of an unofficial motto in Python "Come for the
language, stay for the community."

And to get you started, come join the ppb discord and help us out by
putting our little library through its paces. Link on this slide. See
you in the Q&A.
